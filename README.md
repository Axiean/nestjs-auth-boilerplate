## Description

This boilerplate leverages [NestJs](https://github.com/nestjs/nest), a progressive Node.js framework, for building efficient and scalable server-side applications. MySQL serves as the robust relational database for storing application data, while TypeORM acts as the ORM for seamless interaction between TypeScript code and the database. To manage user accounts and authentication, basic user and auth models are included, and Swagger provides a comprehensive API documentation and testing interface for development and collaboration.
